**Description:**

This repository uses the community medium php sdk. I'm planning to replicate all posts from 
my website (https://rodolfo.io) to Medium so.. let's play a little bit with it.

1) Clone the repository and install dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/rodolfobandeira/php-medium-sdk-studies.git
    cd php-medium-sdk-studies
    composer install
    
2) Edit `config/config.yml` with your Integration Token.

3) Run your application via cli.

    php app.php
